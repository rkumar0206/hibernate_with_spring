### What is hibernate?

- In simple terms, hibernate is a framework which makes it easy for us to connect to the database using JDBC in the background. 
- It makes use of ORM (object relational mapping), by which we can make an entity class with all the fields in the database and hibernate will map these fields to the fields of the database.
- There are two ways to map an entity class using hibernate : 
  * By using configuration file (old method)
  * By using java annotations (new, preffered way)
