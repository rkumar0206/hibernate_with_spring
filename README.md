### One-to-One-uni relationship 

* Itâ€™s a relationship where a record in one entity (table) is associated with exactly one record in another entity (table).
* We use ForeignKey to connect two tables for one-to-one relationship
  
  * ForeignKey : It is the primary key of one table which is saved as a column in another table. And therfore the table can have one-to-one relationship.
